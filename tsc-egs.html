Much of the initial technical work of the FHISO is being carried out in exploratory groups (EGs), each focusing on a specific aspect of the FHISO's work.  The aim of these EGs is not to produce a finished standard, but to research current practice, to determine if and how to proceed with standardisation, and to produce a recommendation on the broad substance of a future FHISO standard.

Non-members are welcome to participate in the work of these exploratory groups, and any interested parties contribute on the group mailing lists.  As a non-member you will not be eligible to participate in any formal votes, however individuals can <a href="/join-fhiso/">join the FHISO</a> for an annual payment of US$20 and then participate fully.

<h2 id="established">Established exploratory groups</h2>

The first EGs have recently commenced work.  If you would like to participate in an open collaborative process to build consensus in these areas, the <a href="/tsc" title="Technical Standing Committee">TSC</a> would welcome your involvement on the EGs' mailing lists.

<dt>Status</dt> <dd>Proposed by Tony Proctor on 2014-08-26 and created on 2014-10-02.</dd>
<dt>Mission</dt> <dd>To produce a lexicon of common usage and best practices for genealogical terminology in the English language.  [<a href="/lexeg">See more&hellip;</a>]</dd>

<h3 id="core">Core Concepts Exploratory Group</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Status</dt> <dd>Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15 and created on 2014-09-23.  Suspended as of 2015-06-19.</dd>
<dt>Mission</dt> <dd>To carry out exploratory work into the core genealogical concepts pertaining to persons, their intrinsic and extrinsic properties, the events in their lives, and the relationships they have with other persons.  [<a href="/cceg">See more&hellip;</a>]</dd>

<h2 id="proposed">Proposed exploratory groups</h2>

The <span title="Technical Standing Committee">TSC are looking for at least three FHISO members willing to commit to participating actively in each of these proposed EGs.   If you are willing to commit, please email us at <a href="mailto:tsc@fhiso.org">tsc@fhiso.org</a> to let us know which group or groups you can commit to participating in.  If you want to discuss the groups more before committing, the <a href="http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-public_fhiso.org"><b>tsc-public</b> mailing list</a> is a good place to do that.  Once each group has support from three members, we will set up the group's mailing list and in due course post an announcement to the <a href="http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org"><b>tsc-announce</b> mailing list</a>.

<h3 id="mod">Modularisation Exploratory Group</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Status</dt> <dd>Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15</dd>
<dt>Focus</dt> <dd>It will be necessary to have separate project teams working on different aspects of the proposed standard, but is it best to publish a single monolithic standard, or is it preferable to divide it into separate modules?  Can different modules be published and updated according to different release schedules?  What implications does this have for forwards and backwards compatibility?  Is it acceptable for applications to support only some modules?  Is there a place for niche modules developed outside the FHISO?  What about vendor extensions?  What consequences does this have for interoperability?</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="formal">Data Formalism Exploratory Group</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Status</dt> <dd>Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15</dd>
<dt>Focus</dt> <dd>We will need a way of describing our data model: what should it be? Should we think about objects with a list of properties as in a SQL database?  Should it be a list of statements linking a subject and object as in the Semantic Web?  Or do we not need an abstract means of describing the data model: do we simply document a serialisation format as GEDCOM does?  Are there standard formalisms that can be used without imposing a particular choice of serialisation format?  How do we specify type constraints: for example that the parent of an individual is another individual and not an event or a date?</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="new">How to propose a new exploratory group</h2>
<p>Perhaps you disagree with our decision to prioritise these particular areas, or think we should start exploring other areas too?  If so, you might like to start a thread on the <a href="/mailman/listinfo/tsc-public_fhiso.org"><b>tsc-public</b> mailing list</a> to let us know and to gauge community support for your suggestion.  FHISO members can formally propose new exploratory groups by email to the <a href="/tsc">TSC</a> at <a href="mailto:tsc@fhiso.org">tsc@fhiso.org</a>.  Once a proposal has been accepted we will list it on this page and announce it on the <a href="/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org"><b>tsc-announce</b> mailing list</a> to solicit commitments of support from members as with the groups proposed above.</p></span>
