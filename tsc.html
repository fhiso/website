<p>The FHISO Technical Standing Committee (TSC) is responsible for coordinating the technical work of the organisation through an open, consensus-based, collaborative standards process, much of which will be conducted by a number of technical groups each working on specific topics.Â  This process is governed by the <a href="/tsc-charter/">TSC charter</a> and <a href="/tsc-opm/">operations &amp; policy manual</a>.  At present the TSC has two members: Luther Tychonievich is the TSC Coordinator.  We can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:tsc@fhiso.org">tsc@fhiso.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="involve">Get involved</h2>

<p>We welcome participation from anyone, whether or not a member of FHISO, providing they are willing to abide by our <a href="/aboutfhiso/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>.  (Non-members are not eligible to participate in any formal votes unless they <a href="/join-fhiso/">join the FHISO</a>.)</p>

<h3>Keep in touch</h3>
<p>We recommend that all interested parties subscribe to the <a href="/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org"><b>tsc-announce</b> mailing list</a>, which is a read-only low volume list where technical announcements are posted by the TSC.</p>

<h3>Submit papers</h3>
<p>The FHISO is operating a <a href="/call-for-papers"><b>call for papers</b></a>.  This is our preferred means of receiving technical proposals, suggestions for functional requirements, or other detailed comment of the technical work of the TSC.  In due course we aim to consider all the suggestions made in these papers and respond to them, but this will take time.</p>

<h3>Join a working group</h3>
<p>Work has begun in several <a href="/tsc-egs"><b>exploratory groups</b></a> and more are proposed.  These groups will do detailed exploratory work into a specific area, document current practice and make recommendations on how FHISO should proceed.  The established groups have mailing lists which anyone can join.  We are also looking for FHISO members willing to commit to supporting the proposed new groups.</p>

<h3>Discuss our work</h3>
<p>The <a href="/tsc-public"><b>tsc-public</b> mailing list</a> exists for all technical discussion on all matters not assigned to a specific exploratory group.  Comments on <a href="/call-for-papers-submissions">paper submissions</a>, the work of the TSC, and the creation of future technical groups are all welcome here.</p>

<h3>Contribute to our bibliography</h3>
<p>We are maintaining an <a href="/bibliography">informal <b>bibliography</b></a> of material that might be useful to our standardisation work.  Please email <a href="mailto:bibliography@fhiso.org">bibliography@fhiso.org</a> with suggestions of what else should be included.</p>
