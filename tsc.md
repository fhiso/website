The FHISO Technical Standing Committee (TSC) is responsible for
coordinating the technical work of the organisation through an open,
consensus-based, collaborative standards process, much of which will be
conducted by a number of technical groups each working on specific
topics. This process is governed by the [TSC charter](/tsc-charter/) and
[operations & policy manual](/tsc-opm/). At present the TSC has two
members: Luther Tychonievich is the TSC Coordinator, and Richard Smith
is TSC Co-Coordinator. We can be contacted by email at
[tsc@fhiso.org](mailto:tsc@fhiso.org).

Get involved {#involve}
------------

We welcome participation from anyone, whether or not a member of FHISO,
providing they are willing to abide by our [code of
conduct](/aboutfhiso/code-of-conduct/). (Non-members are not eligible to
participate in any formal votes unless they [join the
FHISO](/join-fhiso/).)

### Keep in touch

We recommend that all interested parties subscribe to the
[**tsc-announce** mailing
list](/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org), which is a read-only
low volume list where technical announcements are posted by the TSC.

### Submit papers

The FHISO is operating a [**call for papers**](/call-for-papers). This
is our preferred means of receiving technical proposals, suggestions for
functional requirements, or other detailed comment of the technical work
of the TSC. In due course we aim to consider all the suggestions made in
these papers and respond to them, but this will take time.

### Join a working group

Work has begun in several [**exploratory groups**](/tsc-egs) and more
are proposed. These groups will do detailed exploratory work into a
specific area, document current practice and make recommendations on how
FHISO should proceed. The established groups have mailing lists which
anyone can join. We are also looking for FHISO members willing to commit
to supporting the proposed new groups.

### Discuss our work

The [**tsc-public** mailing list](/tsc-public) exists for all technical
discussion on all matters not assigned to a specific exploratory group.
Comments on [paper submissions](/call-for-papers-submissions), the work
of the TSC, and the creation of future technical groups are all welcome
here.

### Contribute to our bibliography

We are maintaining an [informal **bibliography**](/bibliography) of
material that might be useful to our standardisation work. Please email
[bibliography@fhiso.org](mailto:bibliography@fhiso.org) with suggestions
of what else should be included.
