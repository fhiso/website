The Sources and Citations Exploratory Group (or S&CEG) is tasked with carrying out exploratory work into the data representation of information about and information contained within individual documents, monuments, artefacts, interviews, and other sources of data of interest to family history.  The <a href="/tsc">Technical Standing Committee</a> have appointed Sue Adams to be Coordinator of this group and provided the group with <a href="/sceg-directives">directives</a> governing its operation.  Contributions from both experts and the wider genealogical community are welcome and necessary for the work.  Areas of expertise needed include archival standards and genealogical research processes.

A <a href="https://github.com/fhiso/sources-and-citations-eg">repository on GitHub</a> has been provided to contain the ongoing research and analysis of the group.  To follow the work of the S&CEG, you can subscribe to <a href="http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/sources-citations_fhiso.org">their mailing list</a>.
