The <a href="/tsc-charter">TSC Charter</a> and the <a href="/tsc-opm">Operations & Policy Manual</a> (O&PM) talk about ballots as a means of gauging consensus in <a href="/tsc-egs">exploratory groups</a> (EGs), with a steady process of ballots on such proposed resolutions as they become ready.  This page documents a suggested procedure for these ballots.  EGs are free to adopt this procedure or not as they see fit.

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When discussion on an EG's public mailing list reaches a consensus on a technical or procedural matter, any member of the EG (including transitional and associate members) may propose a resolution for adoption by the EG summarising the conclusions reached.  This proposal shall be put to a ballot by the EG Coordinator.</li>

<li>The EG Coordinator may delay a ballot if it seems desirable to ballot several proposals simultaneously, and may seek clarification to the wording if it appears unclear, but will not ordinarily refuse to conduct ballot on a proposal made in good faith.</li>

<li>The Coordinator shall normally conduct the ballot on the EG's public mailing list by sending an email which includes "<tt>[BALLOT]</tt>" in the subject line.  Members vote by replying publicly to the email.  In the event of a matter of particular sensitivity, the <a href="/tsc">TSC</a> can assist in arranging an anonymous ballot.</li>

<li>Per the <a href="/tsc-opm">TSC's Operations & Policy Manual</a>, neither transitional members nor associate members are entitled to vote on a ballot.  A list of current members can normally be found annexed to the EG's Directives.</li>

<li>For every proposal on a ballot, members may vote <tt>ACCEPT</tt>, <tt>REJECT</tt>, <tt>FURTHER DISCUSSION</tt> or <tt>ABSTAIN</tt>.  The only difference between a vote for <tt>REJECT</tt> and a vote for <tt>FURTHER DISCUSSION</tt> is that the latter implies the voter believes further discussion would be productive and may possibly vote to accept a modified version of the proposal in the future.  The Coordinator may vary these options if a multiple-choice proposal is being considered or if circumstances otherwise warrant it.</li>

<li>Discussion during the course of the ballot is not discouraged, but list members are requested to change the subject line for anything other than a vote or procedural question directly related to the ballot.  This is to make it easy to locate all the votes on a given ballot.</li>

<li>The Coordinator may close the ballot after 7 days and announce the outcome on the mailing list.  A proposal is deemed to have passed if the number of <tt>ACCEPT</tt> votes is strictly greater than the combined total of <tt>REJECT</tt> and <tt>FURTHER DISCUSSION</tt> votes.  No quorum or minimum participation level is set.  The Coordinator may leave the ballot open for longer than 7 days if doing so seems likely to increase participation.</li>

<li>The Coordinator may delegate any of these responsibilities to another EG member.  If the Coordinator is absent for an extended period and has not delegated the responsibility, or if the member to whom responsibility has been delegated is also absent, the TSC may temporarily assume these responsibilities.</li>

<li>An explicit vote for <tt>ABSTAIN</tt> constitutes participation in a ballot for the purpose of determining whether or not an EG member is a transitional member.</li>
